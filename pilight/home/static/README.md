Don't edit the contents of this directory! They are produced by Webpack when building the frontend. These files
should be rebuilt whenever updating the frontend.

Also note that index.html here is not used - rather, the home/index.html template is used from Django. This
is more or less the same, but supports proper static file resolution, and includes the installation name.
